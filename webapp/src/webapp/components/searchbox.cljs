  " SEARCHBOX component searches for an item with by a set of values from a shallow object.
  EXAMPLE: given the map {:name :john :last-name :doe :nationality :brazilian}, every value (pointed by searchable-keys) is searchable and will point to its choosen key
  size -> a variation property for a regular sized or a small one. Valid option is :small, if anything else is passed, it will consider the regular
  floating? -> a boolean to set the searchbox as a floating one;
  name -> form name property;
  label -> for adding a label to the combobox. If not provided, the <label> tag won't be rendered;
  list-classes -> to provide some specific stylezation to the list of options, it is expected to be passed CSS classes;
  placeholder -> placeholder form property for input;
  clear? -> a boolean to set a clear first option in the list
  loading? -> a boolean for managing a loading status in the search box list
  selected -> a string with the selected value (see options);
  on-select-result -> a function triggered whenever the user clicks on an result.
  on-change-results-cb -> a callback function to be used on upperscope to have access to the results and manage anything that might be of the upperscope interest
  on-change -> a callback that sends the value in the input for every change in it
  hide-results-list -> a boolean used to do not show the results list. Usually useful with `on-change-results-cb` and the list is not necessary because the results are shown in the upperscope
  on-focus -> a function that will be executed on input focus
  on-blur -> a function that will be executed on input blur
  options -> a list of hashmaps to be rendered searched. Example [{:name \"name\" :type \"type\" :review_type \"review_type\" :redact \"redact\"}] when multiple-options? is false and {:first-list [{:name \"name\" :type \"type\" :review_type \"review_type\" :redact \"redact\"}] :second-list [{:name \"name\" :type \"type\" :review_type \"review_type\" :redact \"redact\"}]} when multiple-options? is true
  multiple-options? -> a boolean to set if the searchbox will search in multiple options or not
  display-key -> the key that will be used to display information in an user friendly way. This key must be from a valid key from options. Example :name
  meta-display-keys -> meta information keys from a option that you want to put to the side of display-key. Example: [:name :type]
  searchable-keys -> the keys from the options that you want to be searchable. Example: [:name :type :review_type :redact]
  icon-position -> a string to set the icon position. Valid options are 'left' and 'right'. Default is 'right'
