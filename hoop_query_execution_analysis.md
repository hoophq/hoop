# Hoop Query Execution Issue Analysis

## Problem Summary

Based on the Slack thread, users are experiencing issues where queries in Hoop are not executing and getting stuck ("Estou tentando executar as querys no hoop, mas elas n√£o executam e ficam travadas la"). This is a critical issue that affects the core functionality of the Hoop.dev access gateway.

## Root Cause Analysis

After analyzing the Hoop codebase, I've identified several potential root causes for queries getting stuck:

### 1. **Connection Pool Timeout Issues**

**Location**: `gateway/transport/dispatchers.go`

The dispatcher system has multiple timeout mechanisms that could cause queries to hang:

- **10-second timeout** for opening sessions (`DispatchOpenSession`)
- **2-second timeout** for sending responses back to API clients
- **500ms timeout** for dispatching session requests

```go
// From dispatchers.go:98
case <-time.After(time.Second * 10):
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("timeout (10s) waiting to open a session")
```

### 2. **Proxy Session Management**

**Location**: `gateway/transport/streamclient/proxy.go`

- **48-hour maximum timeout** for session cleanup
- Proxy streams can get stuck waiting for session cleanup
- Memory cleanup process runs only every 15 minutes

```go
// From proxy.go:45
proxyMaxTimeoutDuration = time.Hour * 48
```

### 3. **Database Connection Layer Issues**

**Location**: `agent/controller/postgres.go`, `agent/controller/mysql.go`

The database connection handling through `libhoop.NewDBCore()` lacks explicit timeout configurations:

- No connection timeout specified in database connection options
- No query timeout set at the database level
- Connections can hang indefinitely waiting for database responses

### 4. **Agent-Gateway Communication**

**Location**: `agent/controller/agent.go`

- **5-second TCP liveness check** timeout
- **10-second TCP connection timeout** for new connections
- No explicit query timeout in database protocol handlers

## Technical Deep Dive

### Connection Flow Analysis

1. **Client Request** ‚Üí **Gateway** ‚Üí **Agent** ‚Üí **Database**
2. Each layer has its own timeout configurations
3. If any layer hangs, the entire query chain gets stuck

### Timeout Hierarchy

```
Client Request
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gateway Dispatcher (10s session timeout)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Proxy Stream (48h max session)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent Controller (5s TCP check)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Database Connection (NO TIMEOUT ‚ö†Ô∏è)
```

## Evidence from Codebase

### Missing Database Timeouts

In `agent/controller/postgres.go` and `mysql.go`, the database connection options don't include essential timeout parameters:

```go
opts := map[string]string{
    "sid":      sessionID,
    "hostname": connenv.host,
    "port":     connenv.port,
    "username": connenv.user,
    "password": connenv.pass,
    // Missing: query_timeout, connection_timeout, read_timeout
}
```

### Connection Pool Issues

The agent uses a basic in-memory store (`memory.Store`) for connection management without sophisticated pool management or timeout handling.

### Critical Discovery: LibHoop No-Op Implementation

**Location**: `_libhoop/libhoop.go`

**Critical Issue**: The `libhoop` package appears to be using no-op (no operation) implementations for all database protocols:

```go
func (p *noopProxy) Run(onErr func(int, string)) {
    errMsg := fmt.Sprintf("missing protocol hoop library for %v, contact your administrator", p.connectionType)
    onErr(1, errMsg)
}
```

This means:
- All database connections return a "missing protocol hoop library" error
- No actual database communication is happening
- Queries appear to be stuck because they're not actually executing

**This could be the primary cause of the stuck query issue** - the actual database protocol implementations may be missing or not properly linked.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (High Priority)

1. **üö® CRITICAL: Investigate LibHoop Implementation**
   - The `_libhoop` directory contains only no-op implementations
   - Actual database protocol implementations may be missing
   - Check if there's a separate proprietary/commercial library that needs to be linked
   - Verify the build process includes the correct database protocol libraries

2. **Add Database Query Timeouts**
   - Implement query timeouts in `libhoop` database connections
   - Add configurable timeout parameters to connection options
   - Default to 30-60 seconds for most queries

3. **Improve Connection Pool Management**
   - Add connection validation before reuse
   - Implement connection health checks
   - Add configurable connection lifetime limits

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Add proper timeout error messages
   - Implement graceful degradation when timeouts occur
   - Log timeout events for debugging

### Medium-term Improvements

1. **Connection Pool Optimization**
   - Implement proper connection pooling with min/max connections
   - Add connection idle timeout management
   - Implement connection retry logic with exponential backoff

2. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Add metrics for connection pool usage
   - Track query execution times
   - Monitor timeout occurrences

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Make timeouts configurable via environment variables
   - Provide different timeout profiles for different connection types
   - Allow per-connection timeout customization

### Long-term Architectural Changes

1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Implement circuit breakers for database connections
   - Automatic failover when connections consistently timeout
   - Health check endpoints for connection status

2. **Advanced Connection Management**
   - Connection multiplexing for better resource utilization
   - Dynamic connection scaling based on load
   - Connection affinity for improved performance

## Specific Code Changes Needed

### 1. Database Connection Timeouts

**File**: `agent/controller/postgres.go`
```go
opts := map[string]string{
    "sid":             sessionID,
    "hostname":        connenv.host,
    "port":           connenv.port,
    "username":       connenv.user,
    "password":       connenv.pass,
    "query_timeout":  "30s",        // Add this
    "connect_timeout": "10s",       // Add this
    "read_timeout":   "30s",        // Add this
}
```

### 2. Connection Validation

**File**: `agent/controller/agent.go`
```go
func (a *Agent) validateConnection(sessionID string) error {
    // Add connection health check before query execution
    // Implement ping/validation logic
}
```

### 3. Timeout Configuration

**File**: `agent/config/config.go`
```go
type Config struct {
    // Existing fields...
    DatabaseQueryTimeout   time.Duration `env:"DB_QUERY_TIMEOUT" envDefault:"30s"`
    DatabaseConnectTimeout time.Duration `env:"DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT" envDefault:"10s"`
    DatabaseReadTimeout    time.Duration `env:"DB_READ_TIMEOUT" envDefault:"30s"`
}
```

## Conclusion

The stuck query issue in Hoop appears to have two potential root causes:

1. **PRIMARY SUSPECT**: The `libhoop` package contains only no-op implementations for all database protocols, which means queries may appear "stuck" because they're not actually executing. This requires immediate investigation to determine if actual database protocol implementations are missing.

2. **SECONDARY ISSUES**: Missing database-level timeouts and inadequate connection pool management could contribute to the problem even if the protocol implementations are correctly linked.

**Immediate Action Required**: Verify that the proper database protocol libraries are linked and functioning. The no-op implementations in `_libhoop/libhoop.go` suggest that either:
- The build process is not including the correct libraries
- There's a separate commercial/proprietary component that needs to be installed
- The open-source version may have limited database protocol support

The recommended approach is to first resolve the protocol implementation issue, then implement the timeout and connection management improvements for long-term stability.
